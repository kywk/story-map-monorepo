# Geo Story Map community submission

The [public 0.1.2 release](https://github.com/kywk/story-map/releases/tag/0.1.2) is ready
with verified download assets. Community submission/review status is still pending;
the plugin is not claimed to be available through the in-app directory yet.

Plugin: **Geo Story Map**, ID `geo-story-map`, version `0.1.2`. Desktop only; minimum
Obsidian `1.8.0`. The maintainer reports successful 1.8.0 opening, Markdown switching,
split-pane resize and disable-cleanup checks. A public API declaration review found no
required API newer than 1.8.0 (`revealLeaf` was introduced in 1.7.2).

## Prepare the release

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
node scripts/check-obsidian-release.mjs
```

Canonical metadata is in root `manifest.json` and `versions.json`. The plugin build
copies them into `packages/obsidian-story-map/dist/`. It also bundles JavaScript/CSS
and generates `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` from the actual bundled dependency licenses.
The scoped view-state wrapper becomes inert on disable and preserves later wrappers.

The GitHub tag must exactly equal the plugin version, **`0.1.2`**, without `v` or
`npm-v`. Attach only `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`.
Do not attach a repository ZIP as a replacement for these files. Obsidian downloads
these three automatically. Full dependency notices are appended to `main.js`; the
separate local notice file is not attached to community releases.
Root `versions.json` supports fallback downloads; a release attachment cannot replace it.

## Submit in the community directory

1. Sign in at [community.obsidian.md](https://community.obsidian.md).
2. Confirm the linked GitHub account is `kywk`.
3. Open **Plugins** and select the action to add a plugin.
4. Enter repository URL `https://github.com/kywk/story-map` and select your account
   as owner. The directory reads the manifest at the default branch's HEAD.
5. Read and accept the developer policies and maintenance commitment, then submit.
6. Open the entry's scanner/review results. Share any errors or warnings for correction.
   A GitHub release alone does not mean community approval or in-app availability.

Suggested short description (also in the manifest):

> Turn Markdown notes into geographic stories with an interactive map and slides.

Suggested long description:

> Build geographic stories from ordinary Markdown notes. Display slides beside a
> synchronized Leaflet map, discover notes recursively from one vault folder, or supply
> explicit slides in your chosen order. Choose metadata-only, linked-title or full-body
> note display. Switch between the map and Markdown without changing your source files.
> Desktop Obsidian 1.8.0 or newer is required. Map tiles and configured remote media
> need a network connection; no plugin account or payment is required.

Screenshots can be added to the listing after capturing the actual plugin; they are
not a substitute for a working release. No screenshots or unperformed tests are claimed.

## Follow-up releases

Update root manifest and plugin package versions together, build and check, then publish
the matching plain-version GitHub tag with fresh assets. Add each release and its minimum
compatibility to `versions.json`. Do not reuse or replace an already published version.

If you previously installed this project's development build in a `story-map` plugin
folder, disable that copy before enabling `geo-story-map`. Do not overwrite the unrelated
community plugin named Story Map.

Official guide: [Submit your plugin](https://docs.obsidian.md/plugins/releasing/submit-plugin).

The `.github/workflows/release-obsidian.yml` workflow builds and attests the three assets
on plain-version tag pushes. Manual dispatch with an existing tag compares public assets
before adding attestations; mismatches fail without replacing files. Verify provenance
with `gh attestation verify main.js --repo kywk/story-map` (also for `styles.css`).
