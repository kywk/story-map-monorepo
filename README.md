# Story Map

A small, reusable Leaflet-based StoryMap stack. One Markdown source and one standard
`StoryMapConfig` render in three hosts:

- standalone React applications;
- an Obsidian plugin (file-backed full-leaf view);
- a Docusaurus site via a Remark build-time transform and browser client.

## Geo Story Map for Obsidian

Turn Markdown notes into geographic stories with an interactive map and slides.
Requires desktop Obsidian 1.8.0 or newer; mobile is not supported in this first release.
The plugin is named **Geo Story Map** (`geo-story-map`); the source syntax remains
`story-map`. It does not require the separate Obsidian Leaflet plugin.

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`
   from the [plugin release](https://github.com/kywk/story-map/releases/tag/0.1.1).
2. Put them in `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/geo-story-map/`.
3. Enable **Geo Story Map** in Settings → Community plugins. Community listing is pending.
4. Create a Markdown document using the Story syntax below, then close and reopen it,
   or run **Geo Story Map: Open as map** from the command palette.
5. Use **Open as Markdown** to edit the same document; the source stays unchanged.

Add notes under the document's `noteFolder`, for example `Travel/Chile/Places/Santiago.md`:

```yaml
---
story-map-note: true
title: Santiago
location: [-33.4489, -70.6693]
date-created: 2026-01-15
description: The journey begins here.
---
```

See [the plugin guide](packages/obsidian-story-map/README.md) for settings and note display.
Geo Story Map is free, needs no plugin account, and includes no telemetry. Maps request
OpenStreetMap tiles by default; configured tile providers and remote media connect to
their specified hosts. The plugin reads notes and attachments inside your vault.

## Packages

| Package | Role | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@story-map/story-map-core` | Framework-agnostic schema, parser, and helpers | npm (0.1.1) |
| `@story-map/react-story-map` | React + Leaflet renderer | npm (0.1.1) |
| `@story-map/remark-story-map` | Remark build-time transform + browser client | npm (0.1.1) |
| `@story-map/obsidian-story-map` | Geo Story Map Obsidian view and Vault resolver | GitHub Release 0.1.1 |

## Quick start

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

`pnpm typecheck` uses TypeScript project references (`tsc -b`), so it builds
`story-map-core` for dependents instead of relying on a stale `dist`.

Run the standalone example:

```bash
pnpm --filter @story-map/example-react dev   # http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

## Story syntax

A StoryMap document is a normal Markdown file with `story-map: true` frontmatter and one
fenced `story-map` configuration block:

````markdown
---
story-map: true
---

```story-map
schema: storymap/v1
title: Chile Trip
map:
  center: [-33.4489, -70.6693]
  zoom: 6
  showPath: true
noteFolder: Travel/Chile/Places
order: asc
dateField: date-created
noteDisplay: link
```
````

`noteFolder` recursively discovers Markdown notes with `story-map-note: true`, ordered by
`dateField` using `order: asc | desc`. Explicit `slides` keep their exact order and are
never reordered or appended to by folder discovery.

`noteDisplay: basic | link | full` controls how resolved notes are shown (default `link`):
frontmatter basics, basics with a title link to the note, or the full frontmatter-stripped
note body. Obsidian opens the note through host callbacks; Docusaurus renders the
published route as a normal browser link.

## Docusaurus

`remark-story-map` transforms each fence at build time into a host element and a browser
client mounts the shared renderer. Configure it with `vaultRoot`, `assetBase`, and a host
`resolveNoteHref` route callback. See `packages/remark-story-map/README.md` and
`examples/docusaurus/`.

## Design rule

`react-story-map` must never import Obsidian or Docusaurus APIs. Platform adapters resolve
notes, WikiLinks, Vault frontmatter, local assets, and routes into a `StoryMapConfig`
before render time.
